# This function takes a data frame and returns a data frame that is massaged into a nice format.
# It is for a csv that results from pasting a the results of SoftMaxPro reading a plate on endpoint mode with any number of shakings before reading it. 
# See the demo folder for a sample input and output file, as well as instructions for running it. 
# use package reshap2 for melt, not reshape.
