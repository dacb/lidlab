This function rearranges column(s) of a data frame into the shape of 96-well blocks, and is intended to convert planning columns into a picture that you can use to load cultures, resin, etc. into 96-well plates.  It accepts well names like H11 (row H, column 11) or 3H11 (plate 3, row H, columns 11)i

it requires:
* a csv with some column that has labels spanning A1 to H12 (with the appropriate set of 96 included) or nA1 to nH12 for an nth plate number
* a list of column names that you want reformatted into your guide

It gives a data.frame you can save to a csv, then do conditional highlighting on in gSpreadsheets or excel.

See the demo package for more detail.  

Required packages:
library(reshape2)  # for melt, cast
library(RCurl) # necessary for getURL below
library(stringr)  #used to get row and column names from well names: str_extract

Arugments:

Argument  | Requirements/Description
------------- | -------------
df | The name of the data.frame that contains your columnar plate info.  Each well should be represented by one row, so there should be 96 rows. 
cols  | A list of the column names, as strings.  Example: c("uL.resin", "mL.culture")
well.identifier  |  The name of the column that contains the well label of the format A1, B6, C12. 

Warnings:
* It will break if you give it a column name that doesn't exist
  * Error 140625: Error in structure(ordered, dim = ns) : 
  dims [product 96] do not match the length of object [0]
